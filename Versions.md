* (almost) all logs on Serial are with timestamps
* don't send HECA logs to Luftdaten API
* support for CO2 sensor - Winsen MH-Z14A, connect it to D6/D5 instead of GPS. So CO2 sensor or GPS no both

* since only one char LCD is supported in given config HTML was changed to dropdown on config page
* memory stats are being collected in more logic way (max/min values measured at end of each loop)
* WiFi password is visible in input field when sensor is being first time configured. When already configured sensor is booted in AP mode, password is not shown (thus saving form with empty field will remove password from config)
